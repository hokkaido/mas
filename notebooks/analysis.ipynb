       "  'body': 'i guess the way I tell it is off. Here is some back story- the dog was left outside with no shelter or food for most of the day to \"train it to be a coon hound\". (I lived by really country folks). When I came upon it that night, it had been bit by a unidentifiable snake and was beat for it, then was fed table scraps ( a half of a baked potato was put in his bowl). I was walking into the sliding door and said \"Hey Pup!\" and patted him on the head. At that point I was bitten and grabbed, as you know those jaws are bred for, I am sure. The only family member he would listen to was the youngest child and he was not there. I had 3 grown men remove the dog and say,\" I am so sorry- we keep him hungry so he will hunt better, and keep him outdoors so he will be acclimated to all weather. I did not blame the dog. That was his life; how he was brought up.

       "  'normalizedBody': 'Long one, \\n I was in Walmart, being chased by a man whom I knew was going to rape me/cause me serious bodily harm. Said Walmart became a maze and was increasingly hard to navigate, then I come upon my ex boyfriend in the yarn section (which I\\'m not sure exists in Walmart stores) and he refused to help me. He said, \"You deserve what is happening to you\". So I\\'m running out of breath, feeling terrified, knowing I\\'m going to be caught when I see the door and run outside. \\n It\\'s raining, and very dark out. Two of my professors are out in the parking lot, one is crying and staring off into the distance. I follow her gaze to see this terrible scene: A bridge over a gaping ravine has collapsed and cars are still driving off the edge and crashing into the river beneath. People are dying right before my eyes, screaming, crying. My ears are filled with a terrible screeching sound louder than any other sobbing and I\\'m suddenly underneath the bridge looking up. \\n I turn around and there\\'s a little girl laying on the river-bank, she\\'s making the screeching sound. I can see blood everywhere but begin to panic when I can\\'t find why she\\'s making this horrifying noise. I place my hands beneath her head and lift her face towards mine. Her eyes are all white and completely void of life. Her mouth grows wider as she screeches and her jaw begins to unhinge. Her teeth grow into long silver  spikes that pierce her lips as they grow, finally her head tears in half completely. \\n Once everything was silent and this \\'girl\\' lay dead on the ground, I grew calm with the thought that it wasn\\'t me that had to suffer. \\n Then I woke up. \\n Tl;Dr: series of unrelated fucked up things reveals that I\\'m a very selfish person. \\n',\n",

Then when coming back to watch the episodes it was more evident what factors were missing from the anime and that affected my views on the series. Now obviously it had its moments, Jura's fight with Hoteye was very well made, but especially the fights on the later stages seemed much worse on anime format. Lucy's and Erza's fights were not that well done and the final fight was made a wee bit too corny compared to the manga. \\n But the real killer was the fact that the anime's delivery of the emotional stuff at the end was just plain worse than the manga's. That could be because I had already known of the coming plot twists, but that hasn't really mattered in any other anime I've watched thus far, nor did it affect my reactions in the Edolas scenes, which in truth were not as sad as the one in the end of Oracion Seis.\",\n",
